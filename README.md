# Deep-Learning-Based-Text-Classification

Applies different deep learning based classification models to consumer complaint data:
1) CNN model
2) RNN with LSTM model
3) CNN with RNF model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09315)
4) Compositional Coding Capsule Newtork (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09177)
5) Seq2Seq with Attention Model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)
6) Neural Semantic Encoder Model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04315)
